# Brain Tumor Classification 
We have used an efficient net model and train it on a Brain MRI dataset. 

This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes -

* Glioma Tumor
* Meningioma Tumor
* Pituitary Tumor
* No Tumor. 

Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with a reasonably high accuracy. 

**Project Prerequisite** :- Before we attempt this project, one should be familiar with programming in Python. One should also have a theoretical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization techniques.
